# JSB Cohort 83

We created a text based choose-your-own advebture game!
Our goroup worked together to come up with the most creative way to test your JavaScript knowlwdge.

We used the following functions: `alert`, `confirm` and `prompt`. These
are all built in browser functions.  They allow you to interact with the user by sending them messages or asking the questions.  With alert, you just send a message, but with confirm and prompt, you can save their response and use it to determine what your game should do next!
